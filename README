Test Bench

If you want to run the test bench, then go to the bench subdirectory and
then run the modelsim do file, i.e. `modelsim_bench.do'. This simulation
will generate an output into a file called `send_out.txt', then you can
compare this file with the original informations, i.e. `senddata.txt',
but first you must discard the first 12 lines before starting the
comparation. This comparation can be done automatically by running
script `analyze.sh' on the bench subdirectory.
